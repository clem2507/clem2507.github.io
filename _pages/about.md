**Welcome to my website**

I'm Clément Detry, a Belgian AI specialist with a focus on computer vision and machine learning. My academic background includes a BSc in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence from [Maastricht University](https://curriculum.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/bachelor/data-science-and-artificial-intelligence) and an MSc in Computer Science and Machine Learning from [Université de Montréal](https://admission.umontreal.ca/programmes/maitrise-en-informatique/) and [Mila Research Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/).

Recently, I completed a role as a Computer Vision Engineer at [HumanWare Technologies](https://www.humanware.com/en-canada/home). I initially joined as an R&D intern during my master's program in Canada, under the supervision of [François Boutrouille](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francois-boutrouille-2b486bb/) and [Alain Bélanger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alain-b%C3%A9langer-eng-msc-mba-3929959/). My work involved developing vision algorithms to support the visually impaired, creating AI-driven features for camera-equipped devices that significantly enhanced user autonomy.

Prior to HumanWare, I worked at [Nomics Care](https://nomicscare.com/en/) as a Data Scientist, a Belgian MedTech company, where I developed AI-driven time-series anomaly detection tools for sleep activity signal monitoring. This experience allowed me to apply machine learning techniques to real-world healthcare challenges.
