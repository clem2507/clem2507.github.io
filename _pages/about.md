**Thank you for visiting my website!**

I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [HumanWare Technologies](https://www.humanware.com/en-canada/home), dedicated to enhancing vision algorithms to support the visually impaired. My work primarily involves developing innovative features that leverage vision AI algorithms, significantly increasing the autonomy of our users through our camera-equipped devices. During my Master’s studies at Université de Montréal and Mila, I embarked on a research internship at HumanWare, under the guidance of [François Boutrouille](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francois-boutrouille-2b486bb/) and [Alain Bélanger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alain-b%C3%A9langer-eng-msc-mba-3929959/). My project focused on enabling indoor object detection for the visually impaired, using a combination of classical object detection algorithms and contrastive meta-learning frameworks.

Prior to joining HumanWare, I completed a Bachelor’s degree in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence from [Maastricht University](https://curriculum.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/bachelor/data-science-and-artificial-intelligence). During my undergraduate studies, I worked with a Belgian MedTech company, [Nomics Care](https://nomicscare.com/en/), where I developed AI-driven time-series anomaly detection tools for monitoring sleep activity signals, assisting doctors with accurate diagnoses. Following this, I advanced my expertise by completing a Master’s program in Machine Learning at [Université de Montréal](https://admission.umontreal.ca/programmes/maitrise-en-informatique/) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/), further deepening my skills and knowledge in cutting-edge AI technologies.
